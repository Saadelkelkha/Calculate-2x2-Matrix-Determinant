# Calculate-2x2-Matrix-Determinant
This program calculates the determinant of a 2x2 matrix. It starts by asking the user to input a 2x2 matrix, where each element is entered by the user. Then, it uses the formula for the determinant of a 2x2 matrix, which is the product of the diagonal elements minus the product of the off-diagonal elements, and prints the result.
